Addres tool
===========

Macintosh "Add Resource" tool for RenderWare Graphics.

Purpose
-------
To operate the CodeWarrior IDE under the MacOS operating system, files must have a resource fork.
These are not generated by default when the RenderWare Graphics SDK is built due to the
cross-compiling system used. Hence the forks must be added by hand. This tool performs this task.

Note that resource forks are already present in the supplied SDK. This tool only needs to be
used on new files that are not generated natively in MacOS.


Packed storage
--------------
The tool is packed in a StuffIt compressed file by default.

	rwsdk/buildtool/addres/addres.sit

StuffIt Deluxe 6.5 for MacOSX was used to compress the file.

The contents of this .sit file are the source, project and executable for the tool.


Use
---
Copy the executable into the folder that contains the files to be worked on.
Double click on the executable to run the tool. Any suitable files found in that
folder will have the necessary resource forks added.

Note that the tool is NOT folder-recursive.
Note that the tool is a classic executable, i.e. in MacOSX it will run in the classic environment.
