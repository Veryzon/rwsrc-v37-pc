# RenderWare Graphics 3.7.0.2 — PC-Windows
**RenderWare Graphics 3.7** is a component of the broader RenderWare suite developed by Criterion Software, focusing specifically on the graphics rendering aspect of game development. RenderWare Graphics was a middleware solution that allowed developers to create high-quality 3D graphics for video games and simulations across a variety of platforms, from consoles to PCs. The version 3.7 marked one of the more advanced stages of this middleware, offering enhanced features for rendering 3D environments and handling complex graphical tasks.

## Key Features and Capabilities of RenderWare Graphics 3.7:
### Cross-Platform Support
Like other components of the RenderWare suite, RenderWare Graphics 3.7 was designed to be cross-platform, supporting platforms like PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PC, and even handheld systems like the Game Boy Advance.
Developers could create content once and then deploy it across multiple hardware platforms, which greatly reduced development time and cost.
### Real-Time 3D Rendering
RenderWare Graphics provided powerful real-time rendering capabilities for 3D graphics, crucial for interactive applications like video games.
The engine could render complex 3D models and environments in real-time, ensuring smooth, responsive gameplay with high visual fidelity.
### Graphics Pipeline
RenderWare used an advanced graphics pipeline that managed the sequence of steps necessary to render 3D graphics.
The pipeline included geometry processing, lighting, shading, texturing, and rasterization, ensuring high-quality visuals across different hardware.
### Shaders and Lighting Effects
One of the strengths of RenderWare Graphics 3.7 was its support for advanced shaders and lighting techniques, including:
* Bump Mapping: For simulating detailed surface textures without adding more polygons.
* Specular Highlights: To create realistic shiny effects on surfaces.
Environment Mapping: For simulating reflections.
* Dynamic Lighting: Including point lights, spotlights, and ambient lights.
* Shadows: RenderWare 3.7 supported dynamic shadows, which added realism to the scenes.
### Texture Mapping and Materials
Texture Mapping was a key feature, allowing textures (images) to be wrapped around 3D models for realism. RenderWare 3.7 supported multiple types of texture mapping, including multi-texturing (using more than one texture on a single object) and cube mapping (for reflective surfaces).
The material system in RenderWare allowed developers to define how a surface reacts to different lighting conditions (e.g., matte, shiny, transparent).
### Advanced Rendering Techniques
RenderWare Graphics 3.7 supported advanced rendering techniques, such as:
Reflections and refraction effects.
Fog and atmospheric effects for creating mood and realism in outdoor and indoor environments.
Particle Systems: For creating visual effects like fire, smoke, and explosions.
### Geometry Management
RenderWare handled complex 3D geometries efficiently, even with large, open-world environments and detailed models. This was particularly useful in games with expansive, dynamic worlds.
The engine supported vertex and index buffers for efficient memory usage and rendering performance.
### LOD (Level of Detail)
RenderWare Graphics 3.7 featured Level of Detail (LOD) management, allowing objects to be rendered in varying levels of detail depending on their distance from the camera. This optimized performance without compromising visual quality, especially in large, complex game worlds.
### Hardware Acceleration Support
The engine took full advantage of hardware acceleration (using GPUs) to deliver higher-quality visuals with less computational overhead on the CPU. It supported a wide variety of graphics hardware, which helped developers target different systems.
### Performance Optimization
RenderWare Graphics 3.7 was optimized to ensure that games ran smoothly on consoles with limited resources (such as the PlayStation 2) while maintaining high-quality visuals.
Features like memory management, texture compression, and optimized shader routines helped in managing the limited hardware resources efficiently.
### Scene Management
The engine included tools for managing complex game scenes with many dynamic and static objects.
It had built-in systems for culling (removing objects that are out of view from the rendering pipeline) and level streaming (loading only parts of the game world as needed).
Popular Games Using RenderWare Graphics 3.7, some of them include:
* Grand Theft Auto III and other games in the Grand Theft Auto series.
Burnout (and sequels) – Renowned for fast, action-packed racing with real-time crash simulations.
* Midnight Club – Open-world racing games with detailed cityscapes and realistic vehicle physics.
* Smuggler's Run – A driving game with detailed environments and terrain rendering.

RenderWare Graphics 3.7 was a powerful, flexible graphics engine that enabled game developers to create visually stunning and performance-efficient games across multiple platforms. It was widely used in the late 1990s and early 2000s and became especially known for its use in open-world and action games. While it has been phased out in favor of modern engines like Unreal Engine and Unity, RenderWare Graphics 3.7 played a significant role in pushing the boundaries of 3D gaming technology during its time.
